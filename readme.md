<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://volunteerbank.io)

There are many great reasons why we started using Github was manyly the cost, not only that being part of the open course community. Then we chose a new framework called jekyll along with our custom made restful API.

Here's why:
* I wanted the ableity to present mulply API's on Github and show a working demo
* Not having overheard costs such as Webhosting
* Having the SSL certificate pushed though by Github is a bonus :smile:
* Wanted to see if I could make a working a CRUD on Github

Of course, to build something that I could show to my peers.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
